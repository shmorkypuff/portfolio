<h3 style= "color: black">Artist Statement</h3>
<p align="left">Alex Alvarado is an artist and creative coder from Chicago. They have decided to explore this medium because it is completely different from anything they had ever done in the past. Since their experience in this type of art is limited, most of their art is just experimental, but a few of their works do have deeper meanings like "Anxi3ty" and "Angel". Some of their other expressive outlets are music, traditional art(sketching and painting), and poetry.  </p>

    <td> <h3 style= "color:orange">ROY G BIV</h3><p align=left>This sketch is titled "ROY G BIV". It is interactive, if you press any of the letters R, O, Y, G, B, I, or V, the color of the swuare changes. YOu can also move the square using your arrow keys. This was an experiment in making art that is interactive resulting in a different user experience.</p></td>

    <td><h3 style= "color:green">Anxi3ty</h3><p>"Anxi3ty" is a visual representation of how thoughts cycle during a panic attack. Each phrase comes at random, but the phrases are confined to a list of ten different thoughts that might pass through my mind during one of these events. The words come and go really fast and are placed at random to further simulate the spontaneous and overwhelming feeling of a panic attack. </p></td>

    <td><h3 style= "color:blue">Thursday</h3><p>"Thursday" is an interesting sketch not because of what it is, but because of how it was made. It is one of five sketches that were made to illustrate a data set. The x value, 12, is representative for how many texts I recieved on Thursday. The y value, 5, is representative of the amount of hours I slept.  </p></td>

    <td><h3 style= "color:purple">black sun</h3>
    <p>"This was one of my first sketches, and it was the first sketch I made that I was actually proud of. 'black sun' is named as such because of the black sphere on the top left corner. It is a really simple scene, but I like the monochromatic color scheme. It was made almost completely with line segments, and although it was pretty difficult to find the right coordinates at first, I eventually got used to it. </p></td>

    <td><h3 style= "color:pink">Angel</h3><p>"Angel" is by far my favorite piece that I've made with the computer as a medium. It started out as a picture I took in the cemetery several months ago. I kept the picture in my camera roll because I thought it looked really cool, but I didn't get to use it to its full potential until I learned about glitch art. It wasn't the first picture I tried to glitch, but it is definitely the one that came out the best. Instead of getting super distorted, it just ended up with a lot of cool, weird lines. The thing I like about "Angel" is that it serves as a metaphor for religious trauma. The tampering of the image is representative of how the perception of religion and religion institutions can be altered due to how some people in the Roman-Catholic Church preach hate and intolerance. </p></td>
